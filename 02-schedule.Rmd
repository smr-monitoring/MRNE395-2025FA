# Schedule {-}

The table below is a comprehensive guide to the semester. The `topics and materials` column has links to learning objectives and a lesson plan and materials used in class each day. The `homework` column outlines the homework schedule. Assume we'll be outside for at least a portion of each class meeting unless I notify you otherwise.
```{r, echo = FALSE, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
library(gt)
library(tidyverse)
library(readxl)
library(kableExtra)
options(knitr.kable.NA = '', table_css = FALSE)

schedule <- read_xlsx("schedule.xlsx")

schedule %>%
  kable(padding = 0) %>%
  collapse_rows() %>%
  kableExtra::kable_styling(font_size = 12,
                            fixed_thead = T,
                            bootstrap_options = c("hover", "condensed"))
```
