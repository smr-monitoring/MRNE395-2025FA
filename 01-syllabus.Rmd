### Course description {-}
Students will learn how to conduct ecological monitoring on the St. Mary’s River, a tidal tributary of Chesapeake Bay. Our primary emphasis will be on water quality monitoring, but we will also dip our toes into some biological and hydrologic monitoring. We'll use quality assurance/quality control measures to ensure our data are up to standard before publishing it to our public-facing data dashboard. This 2-credit course meets once per week and occasionally requires students to work in groups outside of class meetings to collect and process samples. Students should be prepared to work outdoors in inclement weather.

### Course materials {-}
All of the readings and software in this class are either free or will be provided by the instructor.

### Working outside {-}
This course involves outdoor work. Sometimes the weather will be beautiful, but more often it will be hot, sunny, buggy, cold, wet, windy, or a combination of these uncomfortable conditions. We will go out rain or shine unless the conditions are unsafe. It is important that you come to class prepared with whatever you need to keep yourself safe and comfortable outside. It's always a good idea to have a hat and sunscreen and a waterproof layer, even if rain is not in the forecast. For boat work, it is almost always much cooler on the water than land, especially in the spring, so come prepared with multiple layers. Closed-toe shoes are required on the boat. Crocs or sneakers are fine in warm weather. Rubber boots are ideal in cooler weather but sneakers or anything with a grippy rubber sole are fine too. Do not wear flip-flops, heels, or nice shoes that can't get wet or that could scuff up the boat deck. 

I recommend investing in good rain gear especially if you plan to continue doing fieldwork on the water beyond this class. [Grundens](https://grundens.com/) is a reputable marine work gear supplier and they have some affordable options. [Outdoor Research](https://www.outdoorresearch.com/) also sells high-quality gear and you can apply for a [student discount](https://www.outdoorresearch.com/pages/vip-program?gad_source=1&gclid=Cj0KCQjwkdO0BhDxARIsANkNcrfTTRmTvBF6i9f4siwcZSvr-3FYPgDXYPUw5zkBXpXfyFCTJc8cJKAaAtSCEALw_wcB). 

### Learning outcomes {-}
At the completion of this course, students will have an in-depth understanding of why and how we conduct ecological monitoring in coastal systems.

Specific outcomes include being able to:

* describe the ecological and policy context of coastal monitoring
* explain coastal monitoring methods and procedures
* conduct coastal monitoring independently and with a team using standard operating procedures
* Manage and report coastal monitoring data

### Grading and assessment {-}
This course emphasizes qualitative feedback and self-assessment over numeric evaluation. Our assessment system in this class will be "ungrading." Education researcher Alfie Kohn [makes a compelling case](https://www.alfiekohn.org/article/case-grades/) that grading doesn't improve learning and can sometimes even harm learning. Therefore, rather than submitting work in exchange for a letter or number grade, your peers and I will provide qualitative feedback and you will self-assess your learning. Once you’ve gotten oriented with the goals of the course and how the various assignments are designed to assess your achievement of these goals, we’ll work together to come up with a set of criteria for your self-evaluation. At the mid-point and end of the semester, you'll compile a portfolio of your work, reflect on your learning, and make a case for the letter grade you have earned based on your portfolio and these criteria. 

This system is designed to spark your inner motivation to do your best work. We have all been "raised" in a system where most of our learning efforts have revolved around grades, so I know it may be challenging to deviate from that system. I hope that this experience, which puts you in charge of your own learning process and assessment, will be liberating.

**Assignments**

Throughout the semester, we will have some take-home assignments to complete. At the beginning of the semester, they will take the form of guided readings to get you up to speed on coastal restoration and monitoring. These homeworks are designed to help you understand and retain course content in greater depth that can be covered in class. 

Later, you'll work on a project doing a deep dive into water quality monitoring sensors. The final product will be a presentation to the class on your sensor, and there will be a series of interim assignments designed to guide you in completing the final presenation. 

**Practical exam**

Summative assessments evaluate your learning and proficiency at the end of the course. The summative assessment in this course will take the form of a practical exam. We’ll schedule small group meetings in which you demonstrate your ability to properly calibrate instruments, collect samples, etc. Standard operating procedures (SOPs) will be provided for the practical exam. 

### Class policies {-}

**Attendance**

Since this is an ungraded course, I will not automatically dock your grade due to absences. However, when you write your mid-semester and final learning reflections, you should carefully consider how your attendance record - especially repeated absences - may have impacted your learning and, therefore, your grade. If you need to miss class, first make sure to communicate this with me. Then check the class schedule to see what you missed, review relevant slides and activities, and complete missed assignments on your own. If group-based project work took place, be sure to communicate with your team ASAP to come up with a plan for how you will contribute. If you missed a quiz, it’s up to you to schedule a time with me to make it up (office hours are a great time for this). 

**Late work**

I encourage you to stick to assignment deadlines. They exist to keep you on track so you don’t fall behind with coursework. However, I am also flexible if you really need an extra day or two to complete an assignment. Just ask - it’s usually not a problem. With that said, you should think about the purpose of a particular due date and how a late submission will affect your learning. A late submission might mean you will miss the opportunity to get feedback on your work, or you might miss the chance to work collaboratively with your peers. You should take these learning opportunities into consideration before requesting an extension.

**Use of AI**

The use of generative AI in homework assignments is not allowed. The homeworks are designed to help you think and process information and, therefore, learn. If you use AI for this work, you won't be learning! Also AI still tends to generate words that sound good but don't actually say anything of substance (see [this scholarly article](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10676-024-09775-5) for details). If I suspect that you have used AI to create your assignments, you can expect to have a conversation with me!

You might consider using AI to help you develop study guides. However, again, the process of creating your own study guide [has been shown](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/87567555.2018.1514485) to help students study and learn more efficiently, so consider the benefit of developing your own guide.

**Engaged learning**

SMCM has recently decreased the amount of time allocated to class meetings. Because our course meeting times are longer than required for a 2-credit course, most of our "engaged learning" will take place via hands-on activities in class. Occasionally, students will also make some monitoring measurements on their own outside of class. 

**Office hours**

Office hours are set times dedicated to students. This means that I will be in my office waiting for you to come by talk to me during that time. 

### SMCM resources {-}

**Accommodations and Accessibility:** SMCM is committed to providing access to the learning and living experience to students with disabilities and disabling health conditions. If you have received a letter from the Office of Accessibility Services (OAS), which outlines the academic accommodations to which you are entitled to and you want  those accommodations to apply to this course, you MUST share your letter and meet with me to review that letter. If you suspect that you have a learning or living need related to a disability or disabling health condition that could benefit from  accommodations, you should contact the Office of Accessibility Services, who can help you learn more about how to proceed.

**The Writing and Speaking Center:** Located on the first floor of the main Library, the Writing & Speaking Center offers free peer tutoring in writing and speaking. The peer tutors are students themselves, but they have completed extensive hands-on training to learn how to assist their peers at any step of the process (planning, drafting, or revising) for any writing or speaking assignment. The peer tutors will not make decisions about revision for you and will instead work collaboratively with you to discuss ideas and consider options so that you can choose how best to revise on your own. This collaborative approach is one of the best ways to help students develop their abilities because all writers and speakers need audiences—just ask the peer tutors, who often schedule tutorials with each other. To make an appointment, please visit www.smcm.edu/writingcenter and click the “Schedule an Appointment” button. If you have questions or need assistance, please contact Director Ben Click at baclick@smcm.edu.
