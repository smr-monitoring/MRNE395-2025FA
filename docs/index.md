# Welcome {-}

This is the homepage for ENST/MRNE 395 Coastal Monitoring taught by Dr. Cassie Gurbisz in Spring 2025 at St. Mary's College of Maryland. All course materials will be posted on this site, accessible through the [Schedule](https://smr-monitoring.github.io/MRNE395-2024FA/schedule.html) page and the navigation bar on the left.

This website was built with the [bookdown](https://bookdown.org/yihui/bookdown) R package with help from [rstudio4edu](https://rstudio4edu.github.io/rstudio4edu-book/).
