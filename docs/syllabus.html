<div id="course-description" class="section level3 unnumbered hasAnchor">
<h3>Course description<a href="syllabus.html#course-description" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h3>
<p>Students will learn how to conduct ecological monitoring on the St. Mary’s River, a tidal tributary of Chesapeake Bay. Our primary emphasis will be on water quality monitoring, but we will also dip our toes into some biological and hydrologic monitoring. We’ll use quality assurance/quality control measures to ensure our data are up to standard before publishing it to our public-facing data dashboard. This 2-credit course meets once per week and occasionally requires students to work in groups outside of class meetings to collect and process samples. Students should be prepared to work outdoors in inclement weather.</p>

<div id="course-materials" class="section level3 unnumbered hasAnchor">
<h3>Course materials<a href="syllabus.html#course-materials" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h3>
<p>All of the readings and software in this class are either free or will be provided by the instructor.</p>
</div>
<div id="working-outside" class="section level3 unnumbered hasAnchor">
<h3>Working outside<a href="syllabus.html#working-outside" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h3>
<p>This course involves a lot of outdoor work. Sometimes the weather will be beautiful, but more often it will be hot, sunny, buggy, cold, wet, windy, or a combination of these uncomfortable conditions. We will go out rain or shine unless the conditions are unsafe. It is important that you come to class prepared with whatever you need to keep yourself safe and comfortable outside. It’s always a good idea to have a hat and sunscreen and a waterproof layer, even if rain is not in the forecast. For boat work, it is almost always much cooler on the water than land, especially in the spring, fall, and winter, so come prepared with multiple layers. Closed-toe shoes are required on the boat. Crocs or sneakers are fine in warm weather. Rubber boots are ideal in cooler weather but sneakers or anything with a grippy rubber sole are fine too. Do not wear flip-flops, heels, or nice shoes that can’t get wet or that could scuff up the boat deck.</p>
<p>I recommend investing in good rain gear especially if you plan to continue doing fieldwork on the water beyond this class. <a href="https://grundens.com/">Grundens</a> is a reputable marine work gear supplier and they have some affordable options. <a href="https://www.outdoorresearch.com/">Outdoor Research</a> also sells high-quality gear and you can apply for a <a href="https://www.outdoorresearch.com/pages/vip-program?gad_source=1&amp;gclid=Cj0KCQjwkdO0BhDxARIsANkNcrfTTRmTvBF6i9f4siwcZSvr-3FYPgDXYPUw5zkBXpXfyFCTJc8cJKAaAtSCEALw_wcB">student discount</a>.</p>

<h3>Learning outcomes<a href="syllabus.html#learning-outcomes" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h3>
<p>At the completion of this course, students will have an in-depth understanding of why and how we conduct ecological monitoring in coastal systems.</p>
<p>Specific outcomes include being able to:</p>
<ul>
<li>describe the ecological and policy context of coastal monitoring</li>
<li>explain coastal monitoring methods and procedures</li>
<li>conduct coastal monitoring independently and with a team using standard operating procedures</li>
<li>Manage and report coastal monitoring data</li>

<div id="grading-and-assessment" class="section level3 unnumbered hasAnchor">
<h3>Grading and assessment<a href="syllabus.html#grading-and-assessment" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h3>
<p>This course uses a variation of “specifications grading,” where we rely less on evaluating every assignment with a letter or number and instead focus on making sure we’re generally making good progress in our learning. <a href="https://www.alfiekohn.org/article/case-grades/">Research has shown</a> that grading doesn’t improve learning and can sometimes even harm learning. Rather than submitting work “in exchange” for a letter or number grade, most assignments will be evaluated based on whether or not they meet the “specifications,” or “specs” of that particular assignment. The final exam serves as a way to show your cumulative mastery of the learning outcomes.</p>
<p>The following outlines the grading system:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>A:</strong> Meet specs on at least 9 homeworks and earn at least 90% on the final exam</li>
<li><strong>B:</strong> Meet specs on at least 8 homeworks and earn at least 80% on the final exam</li>
<li><strong>C:</strong> Meet specs on at least 7 homeworks and earn at least 70% on the final exam</li>
<li><strong>D:</strong> Meet specs on at least 6 homeworks and earn at least 60% on the final exam</li>
<li><strong>F:</strong> Meet specs on less than 6 homeworks or earn below a 60% on the final exam or 3 or more absences</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Attendance</strong></p>
<p>This is a very hands-on course where most of the learning takes place in person. It will be hard to learn and, therefore, pass the class if you’re not here to participate. This is why attendance is included in the specs for a final grade of F. Since we only meet once per week, missing 3 class sessions is equal to missing three weeks of class. Since most of the learning involves in-person, interactive activities, it will be difficult if not impossible to meet the course learning objectives if you miss this much class. If you have a documented emergency or health issue that will require an extended absence, talk to me and we can work together to develop a plan to help you move forward.</p>
<p><strong>Homework assignments</strong></p>
<p>Weekly assessments will take the form of written homework assignments. They are designed to help you understand and retain course content in greater depth that can be covered in class. We will go over the answers to each homework assignment in class on the day they are due, so late work will not be accepted. If you miss class on the day a homework assignment is due, it must be submitted by the next class meeting. Learning outcomes for each week will be provided and each homework assignment will assess those outcomes. Since the final exam will assess the same learning outcomes, these assignments will serve as great study material for the exam.</p>
<p>Homework assignments are evaluated on a “meets specs/does not meet specs.” The specs for each assignment will be clearly articulated in the assignment document.</p>
<p><strong>Final exam</strong></p>
<p>Summative assessments evaluate your learning and proficiency at the end of the course. The summative assessment in this course will take the form of an exam that has both a written and practical component. The written portion will assess your understanding of the ecological and policy context of coastal monitoring and your grasp of monitoring standard operating procedures. For the practical component, we’ll schedule individual meetings in which you demonstrate your ability to properly calibrate instruments, collect samples, etc. Standard operating procedures (SOPs) will be provided for the practical exam. Students can use one page of hand-written notes for the written exam portion.</p>
<p><strong>Extra credit</strong></p>
<p>The specs grading system is designed to reduce anxiety over grades, but I recognize that you still may experience some stress if you miss one too many homeworks or if your exam grade is just beyond the benchmark for grade you want to earn. I will offer multiple opportunities that will enable you to earn one extra credit, which you can use to add two points to your final exam grade or use as a “free pass” to automatically meet specs on one homework assignment or add a plus to your final grade. So if, for example, you earn a 78% on the exam, your extra credit can be used to increase the grade to an 80% and you can, therefore earn a B in the class. Or if you only meet the specs on 8 quizzes but you needed to pass 9 to earn an A, you can use one of your extra credit points to automatically pass your missing homework. Or if you meet the specs to earn a B, you can use your extra credit to earn a B+. I will notify you of extra credit opportunities as soon as they arise.</p>

<div id="more-policies" class="section level3 unnumbered hasAnchor">
<h3>More policies<a href="syllabus.html#more-policies" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h3>
<p><strong>Missing class</strong></p>
<p>If you need to miss class, first make sure to communicate this with me. Then check the class <a href="https://smr-monitoring.github.io/MRNE395-2024FA/schedule.html">schedule</a> to see what you missed, review relevant slides and readings, and complete missed assignments on your own.</p>
<p><strong>Use of AI</strong></p>
<p>The use of generative AI in homework assignments is not allowed. The homeworks are designed to help you think and process information and, therefore, learn. If you use AI for this work, you won’t be learning! Also AI still tends to generate words that sound good but don’t actually say anything of substance (see <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10676-024-09775-5">this scholarly article</a> for details). If I suspect that you have used AI to create your assignments, you can expect to have a conversation with me!</p>
<p>You might consider using AI to help you develop study guides. However, again, the process of creating your own study guide <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/87567555.2018.1514485">has been shown</a> to help students study and learn more efficiently, so consider the benefit of developing your own guide.</p>
<p><strong>Engaged learning</strong></p>
<p>SMCM has recently decreased the amount of time allocated to class meetings. Because our course meeting times are longer than required for a 2-credit course, most of our “engaged learning” will take place via hands-on activities in class. Occasionally, students will also make some monitoring measurements on their own outside of class.</p>
<p><strong>Office hours</strong></p>
<p>Office hours are set times dedicated to students. This means that I will be in my office waiting for you to come by talk to me during that time.</p>

<p><strong>The Writing and Speaking Center:</strong> Located on the first floor of the main Library, the Writing &amp; Speaking Center offers free peer tutoring in writing and speaking. The peer tutors are students themselves, but they have completed extensive hands-on training to learn how to assist their peers at any step of the process (planning, drafting, or revising) for any writing or speaking assignment. The peer tutors will not make decisions about revision for you and will instead work collaboratively with you to discuss ideas and consider options so that you can choose how best to revise on your own. This collaborative approach is one of the best ways to help students develop their abilities because all writers and speakers need audiences—just ask the peer tutors, who often schedule tutorials with each other. To make an appointment, please visit www.smcm.edu/writingcenter and click the “Schedule an Appointment” button. If you have questions or need assistance, please contact Director Ben Click at <a href="mailto:baclick@smcm.edu" class="email">baclick@smcm.edu</a>.</p>
