# Extra credit {-}

The following are extra credit opportunities that you can use for this class. For unstructured activities, you need to spend at least 1 hour on the activity. When you have completed the extra credit activity, you'll write a half-page (single-spaced) reflection describing what you did and drawing linkages between the activity and the course. Be as detailed and descriptive as possible. Reflections need to be submitted within 1 week of completing the activity.

```{r, echo = FALSE, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
#library(magrittr)
#library(kableExtra)
#options(knitr.kable.NA = '')
#options(kableExtra.html.bsTable = T)
#kable(readxl::read_xlsx("/Users/cbgurbisz/Documents/Teaching/ENST 392/website/extra-credit.xlsx")) %>%
#  kable_styling(font_size = 12,
#                            fixed_thead = T,
#                            bootstrap_options = "hover")
```
